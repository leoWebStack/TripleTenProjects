      <h2 class="h2_card">Music</h2>
      <p class="p_card">Music has always been a big part of my life. I don't play any instruments (yet!), but I love discovering new sounds and artists. Whether it’s chill vibes, Brazilian beats, or energetic electronic music, there’s always something playing in the background while I work or relax.</p>

      <h2 class="h2_card">Friends</h2>
      <p class="p_card">Staying connected with friends is a huge part of who I am. I love sharing stories, laughs, and supporting each other through all of life’s ups and downs. Good friends are like chosen family, and while living in Ireland I select quite a few I can call that way.</p>

      <h2 class="h2_card">Family</h2>
      <p class="p_card">My heart is split between two places: I live in Ireland, but my family is in Brazil. Despite the distance, we stay close and connected. They’ve always supported my journey, and they’re a big part of the reason I keep pushing forward.</p>

      <h2 class="h2_card">Web Development</h2>
      <p class="p_card">I recently graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Computing and IT, and now I’m diving deep into web development through my course at TripleTen Brazil. I love building things with code and bringing ideas to life on the screen. This is just the beginning of the journey!</p>
